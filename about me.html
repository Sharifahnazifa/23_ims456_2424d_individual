    <p> 
        I come from a close-knit and loving family that has played a significant role in shaping who I am today. My family consists of my parents, Syed and Ruzi, and I have 6 Siblings.
        My father, Syed, is a hardworking Businessman who has his own business in Architecture fields. My mother, Ruzi, is a dedicated teacher who has been in the education field for over 20 years. 
        Growing up, our family placed a strong emphasis on education and personal growth. They taught us the importance of hard work, perseverance, and integrity.
        Overall, my family has been a constant source of love, support, and inspiration. Their guidance and encouragement have shaped my values and aspirations. I am grateful for have best family ever!.
